<h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Edgar Salinas, I'm from Reynosa, Tamaulipas.
    As of right now, I'm studying the full stack web developer at "Tec de Monterrey"
    <br> <br>
    I've always like music. I used to play the bass a few years ago, but right now
    I only play it every once in a while. I prefer to listen some good alternative rock
    music, but I also listen to some other genres.
    <br><br>
    I like to play some video games when I have some free times. Right now I mainly play
    League of Legends. Since it takes a lot of time for each game i rarely have time for 
    a different game, but before I used to play a different variety.
